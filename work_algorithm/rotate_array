# Rotate Array
think

Follow up:

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
+ build new array
+ rotate     directly
+ use list to make a ring?
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?




```func rotate(nums []int, k int)  {
    k %=len(nums)
    re(nums)
    re(nums[:k])
    re(nums[k:])
}
func re(a []int){
     for i,n:=0,len(a);i<n/2;i++{
         a[i],a[n-1-i]=a[n-1-i],a[i]
     }
}

```
